[GlobCover](http://due.esrin.esa.int/page_globcover.php) from
[ESA](https://www.esa.int/ESA) proposes global raster file (300-m
resolution) of land cover for 2005 and 2009. After having been croped to
the province of Vientiane prefecture (see [cleaning
pipeline](https://ecomore2.github.io/globcover/make_data.html)), the
`.GTiff` files are available
    here:

  - [GlobCover2005\_V2.2.tif](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gp790fng3awwb7t/Globcover2005_V2.2.tif?raw=1)
    (37
    Ko)
  - [GlobCover2009\_V2.3.tif](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2fdtq8jofs38tf/Globcover2009_V2.3.tif?raw=1)
    (38 Ko)

The files can be downloaded directly from R as so:

``` r
library(raster)
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/gp790fng3awwb7t/Globcover2005_V2.2.tif?raw=1", tmp)
Globcover2005_V2.2 <- raster(tmp)
download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2fdtq8jofs38tf/Globcover2009_V2.3.tif?raw=1", tmp)
Globcover2009_V2.3 <- raster(tmp)
```

The legend of these raster files are:
